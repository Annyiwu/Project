      <p>
        Just like every lady, I am always tempted by the glamor of gemstone jewelry, and my interests in gemstone jewelry were deepened since my internship in Gucci Fashion Jewelry, where I started to understand that the manufacturing and refinement of each fine jewelry piece is indeed way more complicated beyond peopleâ€™s imagination. Meanwhile, as an undergraduate student at Babson College, I am always looking for the sustainability of each industry field, and so have found the gemstone industry actually harmed the environment in some way during the sourcing process. Thus, bring my interests and hope together, I built this website for any gemstone lover to grab some information, and at the same time hope they and the industry could start considering these environmental impacts.
