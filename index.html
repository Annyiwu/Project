          <p class="text-primary" id="Ann">
              Just like every lady, I am always tempted by the glamor of gemstone jewelry, and my
            interests in gemstone jewelry were deepened since my internship in Gucci Fashion Jewelry, where I started to
            understand that the manufacturing and refinement of each fine jewelry piece is indeed way more complicated
            beyond peopleâ€™s imagination. Meanwhile, as an undergraduate student at Babson College, I am always looking
            for the sustainability of each industry field, and so have found the gemstone industry actually harmed the
            environment in some way during the sourcing process. Thus, bring my interests and hope together, I built
            this website for any gemstone lover to grab some information, and at the same time hope they and the
            industry could start considering these environmental impacts.</p>
