                        85% of annual diamonds are mined from Kimberlite through alluvial mining, pipe mining, and
                        marine mining.

                        As shown on the map, the sourcing origins of colored gemstone sources of origin cover all inhabited continents with significant southern hemisphere concentration. For some types of gems, sources are limited to a few countries, and occasionally, to just one or two (e.g. tanzanite in Tanzania). Other gems have over 20 potential sources (such as quartzes, which are very common).

                    <p class="text-primary">
                        Colored gemstones (ASM): Unlike diamonds, about 80% colored gemstones mining is usually worked
                        by independent miners in artisanal and small‐scale mining globally, and is used with different
                        methods varying from native mining to highly sophisticated technical mining methods.

                        <li>
                            Alluvial Mining: is conducted by building walls or diverting rivers to expose the
                            diamond-bearing dry river or ocean bed, and wash diamonds with natural forces such as wind,
                            rain and water currents.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Pipe Mining: is developed after alluvial mining to avoid waiting time. This method of mining
                            allows diamond miners to strike closer to the source—the kimberlite pipes and mining diamond
                            either open-pit or underground.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Open case mining: by removing overlying minerals or rocks, the miners are able to reach
                            gemstones bearing rocks and then wash the rocks by jet of water under high pressure to
                            obtain gems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Terrace mining: the method of digging horizontal terraces in circular formation to obtain
                            gem-bearing rocks, and is most often used by emerald mining in Columbia.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Tunnelling: it is the technique used when gem-bearing rock is extremely close to the
                            surface, and so a tunnel will be built to reach the deposit and pick up individual gems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Undersea or marine mining: it is a relatively complicated process involving land reclamation
                            or deep sea dredging and often accompanied by sophisticated technological support. Deposits
                            such as Namaqualand diamond in West Africa was obtained via this way.

                            Dry Diggings: it is one of the ethical sourcing methods that change a river’s course either
                            naturally or artificially by blocking the river and creating a canal to create rock beds and
                            dry the gemstones.

                    <h2>Polishing</h2>
                    <p class="text-primary">
                        After faceting the gemstones, also known as shaping, the gems are cut with appropriate angle,
                        side and amount decided by the faceting machines. And now comes the most important part to
                        polish the gems so that the gems are clean and ready to reflect all the allure.
                        <br>
                        In fact, there are no directions of what agents to use for polishing and the polishing process
                        depends heavily on an individual faceter’s empirical experience, or based on information
                        available from faceting classes. That is one of the reasons why gemcutters are often very
                        inventive and faceting(shaping and polishing) is considered an art. Here are some common
                        polishing methods and agents used:
                        <br>
                    <p class="text-primary">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Most important and general rule to remember:gemstone is usually polished to a mirror-like
                            finish to aid light reflection from the surface of the stone.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Very fine grades of diamond (50,000 to 100,000 mesh) can be used to polish a wide variety of
                            materials.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Common polishing agents are metal oxides such as aluminum oxide (alumina), cerium oxide, tin
                            oxide, and etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rounded surfaces, such as on cabochons, are often polished on felt, leather, cork, cloth, or
                            wood. This is the finished stone off the dop and cleaned.
                        </li>
